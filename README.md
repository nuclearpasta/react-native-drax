## Overview

Drax is a declarative drag-and-drop system for React Native, written in TypeScript. It is designed to be flexible and powerful with the goal of supporting many use cases, while its stock components and default settings should cover the most common scenarios with minimal configuration.

**Note: We currently only support the latest Expo and React Native versions. Other older version might work just fine, but we won't respond to bug reports or feature requests for them.**

### Experimental Alpha Version (v0.11.0)

An experimental alpha version is now available that introduces significant updates and breaking changes. This version focuses on:

- Integration with latest React Native Reanimated and React Native Gesture Handler by SoftwareMansion
- Enhanced animation performance and capabilities
- Works with New Architecture

**Installation:** To install the experimental alpha version:

```bash
# npm
npm install react-native-drax@alpha

# or yarn
yarn add react-native-drax@alpha
```

You'll also need to ensure you have the required peer dependencies:

```bash
yarn add react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler
```

**Important:** This alpha version contains breaking changes, especially to the `DraxList` component. See the [Alpha Version Breaking Changes](#alpha-version-breaking-changes) section for details.

*Personal note from Joe: this project is in need of additional [contributors/shepherds](#contributing). I have not been focused on React Native over the past year, and the state of the library has fallen behind the times. At a minimum, it should be updated to use the latest RNGH and take advantage of any fixes and new features in that and RN. I apologize that I do not have the availability to maintain this project to my own high standards and thank everyone who has been understanding of that.*

## Status

This library adheres to [Semantic Versioning (semver)](https://semver.org/) and is in its [0.y.z initial development phase](https://semver.org/#how-should-i-deal-with-revisions-in-the-0yz-initial-development-phase). It has been released so that early adopters (such as the project author) can begin to use it in production and identify gaps in the functionality. The API is subject to potentially significant rework until version 1.0.0 is released, and any minor version increment before then may include breaking changes. Documentation and full examples are still being written.

The author of this library has not had significant availability to work on it for quite a while now, due to higher priority life and work concerns. Newer versions of Drax's major dependencies have been released in that time, and many people have opened issues asking questions about usage and potential features. Relatively small fixes and easy questions are handled reasonably often, but ultimately another round of research, testing, and architecture are what would take this library to the next level of usability. It is not clear when that might happen, but [contributors are welcome](#contributing).

## Alpha Version Breaking Changes

The experimental alpha version (v0.11.0) includes significant updates to modernize the library and improve performance. However, these changes introduce breaking changes, particularly to the `DraxList` component.

### DraxList Breaking Changes

   - `renderItem` property signature receives different props than before and has replaced `renderItemContent` and `renderHoverContent`
   - Receives incoming external drag items inside the list.
   - Added `monitoringExternalDragStyle` prop for styling during incoming external drags
   - `parentDraxViewProps` prop for customizing the parent DraxView wrapping the FlatList. You should use this prop if you were using the `style` prop on `DraxList`. (see example below)

### DraxListItem Component

The alpha version introduces a new `DraxListItem` component that works with `DraxList` to simplify implementation of reorderable lists. This component handles animations, measurement caching, and shift calculations internally.

#### Usage Example

```jsx
import { DraxList, DraxListItem } from 'react-native-drax';

const MyReorderableList = () => (
  <DraxList
    data={items}
    // BREAKING CHANGE: `style` prop is now applied to internal FlatList, not to the parent DraxView
    style={styles.list}

    // should use this prop if you were using the `style` prop on `DraxList` on v0.10.3. 
    parentDraxViewProps={{
      style: styles.list,
    }}
    renderItem={(info, itemProps) => (
      <DraxListItem
        itemProps={itemProps}
        style={styles.listItem}
        draggingStyle={styles.itemDragging}
        dragReleasedStyle={styles.itemReleased}
        // Any other DraxView props
      >
        <Text>{info.item.text}</Text>
      </DraxListItem>
    )}
    onItemReorder={({fromIndex, toIndex}) => {
      // Update your data here
      const newData = [...items];
      const item = newData.splice(fromIndex, 1)[0];
      newData.splice(toIndex, 0, item);
      setItems(newData);
    }}
  />
);
```

## Background

To give an idea of the problem this library is trying to solve, here is some informal background:

> In our React Native application we had a screen which showed a
> FlatList of cards that could be scrolled through or individually
> tapped to view details. We wanted to add the ability for a user
> to long-press a card then drag it into a different position in
> the list; in other words, we needed a reorderable list.
>
> I figured there must already be a library out there that would
> suit our needs. I tried out a few different packages, which each
> looked to have pros and cons, but nothing quite worked right how
> we expected. To complicate things further, our application used
> `react-navigation`, which seemed to conflict with some of them.
>
> We also had future features on our roadmap which would necessitate
> a more generic drag-and-drop solution. I found it a bit odd that,
> although reorderable lists and drag-and-drop have much functional
> overlap, there didn't seem to be a package for React Native which
> did both. It looked like React for the web was a little more mature
> in this arena, but that didn't help us. I asked some other
> developers if they knew of a solid React Native library for this,
> but they agreed that it was a gap in the ecosystem.
>
> I decided to create my own drag-and-drop library, including
> stock components for common behaviors. The goal, first and
> foremost, was to fulfill our draggable reorderable list wish.
> But beyond that, I wanted a robust foundation that could be
> used to flexibly implement various drag-and-drop-related
> solutions. I am sure that there are scenarios I have not
> yet considered, and I am open to input from other people
> who are working in this space.

<a name="concept"></a>
## Concept

Descriptions of the library's approach, underlying implementation, and drag-and-drop event lifecycle can be found in the [Concept Document](docs/concept.md).

<a name="installation"></a>
## Installation

First you must have a project using `react-native` version `>=0.62`, including `react-native-gesture-handler` version `>=1.8.0`. For further information on installing the latter, see [that library's documentation](https://software-mansion.github.io/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/getting-started.html).

Then simply install Drax with:

`yarn add react-native-drax`

or

`npm install react-native-drax`

There is no Cocoapods or native linking step here. You've already covered those needs with `react-native-gesture-handler`.

<a name="usage"></a>
## Usage

### Basic Usage

Import the library components:

```ts
import { DraxProvider, DraxView } from 'react-native-drax';
```

Wrap the area of your app that will use Drax with a `DraxProvider`, and create a couple `DraxView`s, one draggable and one receptive:

```tsx
<DraxProvider>
    <View style={styles.container}>
        <DraxView
            style={styles.draggable}
            onDragStart={() => {
                console.log('start drag');
            }}
            payload="world"
        />
        <DraxView
            style={styles.receiver}
            onReceiveDragEnter={({ dragged: { payload } }) => {
                console.log(`hello ${payload}`);
            }}
            onReceiveDragExit={({ dragged: { payload } }) => {
                console.log(`goodbye ${payload}`);
            }}
            onReceiveDragDrop={({ dragged: { payload } }) => {
                console.log(`received ${payload}`);
            }}
        />
    </View>
</DraxProvider>
```

The styles are provided here for completeness:

```ts
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
    container: {
        flex: 1,
        justifyContent: 'center',
        alignItems: 'center',
    },
    draggable: {
        width: 100,
        height: 100,
        backgroundColor: 'blue',
    },
    receiver: {
        width: 100,
        height: 100,
        backgroundColor: 'green',
    },
});
```

This will give you a blue box which can be dragged around and a green box which it can be dragged into. Watch the console log messages while you drag the blue box around, releasing the drag either in or out of the green box.

### API

<a name="caveats"></a>
## Caveats

This library has several [known issues and limitations](https://github.com/nuclearpasta/react-native-drax/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Areproduced), particularly around the [Android](https://github.com/nuclearpasta/react-native-drax/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aandroid) platform. We hope to address these and improve the library over time. For most use cases, the current functionality is probably fine.

This library currently expects React Native >=0.62 and React Native Gesture Handler >=1.8. Due to complexity, we cannot support the use of the library with older versions.

<a name="examples"></a>
## Examples

A reference application can be found at [`react-native-drax-example`](https://github.com/nuclearpasta/react-native-drax-example) demonstrating several use cases.

If you don't want to download and run the sample application, here are two Snack examples:

- [Basic drag-and-drop](https://snack.expo.io/@lafiosca/react-native-drax---basic-drag-and-drop?platform=ios)
- [Basic reorderable list](https://snack.expo.io/@lafiosca/react-native-drax---basic-reorderable-list?platform=ios)

Note: these Snack examples will not work in the Web device. You must use an iOS (default) or Android device.
